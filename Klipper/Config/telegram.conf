[progress_notification]
#percent: 0
#	This is an interval in percent, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5, notifications are sent at 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.
#	When set to 3, notifications are sent at 3%, 6%, 9%, etc.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print percentage.
#	This value should be an integer >=0.
#height: 0.0
#	This is an interval in mm, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5.0, notifications are sent at 5.0mm, 10.0mm, 15.0mm, etc, print height.
#	When set to 0.25, notifications are sent at 0.25mm, 0.5mm, 0.75mm, etc, print height.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print height.
#	This value should be an float >=0.0.
time: 600
#	This is the recommended way to use progress notifications.
#	This is an interval in seconds, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 600, notifications are sent at 600 seconds, 1200 seconds, 1800 seconds, etc, print time.
#	When set to 100, notifications are sent at 100 seconds, 200 seconds, 300 seconds, etc, print time.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on time.
#	This type of notifications continues, even when the print is paused. So if your printer triggers a pause, for example 
#	caused by filament runout, you will still get notifications regularly, until the print is completed/canceled.  
#	This value should be an integer >=0.
#groups: group_id_1, group_id_2
#	When running multiple printers/a farm, you may want to aggregate all notifications from all printers in a group.
#	You can enter group IDs here, to which notifications will be sent. No control from a group is possible.
#	Only notifications are sent.
#	Telegram group IDs are negative integers.
#	This should be a list of integers.
#group_only: false
#	If you are using the group feature, you might want to disable individual notifications and use group notifications only.
#	Set this to true to disable individual notifications in individual chats.
#	This value should be boolean.

[telegram_ui]
eta_source: slicer
#	You can choose, which value to use for remaining time estimation.
#	Default value is slicer.
#	Allowed values: slicer, file
#buttons: [status,pause,cancel,resume],[files,emergency,macros,shutdown]
#	You can redefine, which buttons and in which position you want displayed.
#	If this is not defined, the default order is used. Buttons are defined per row, each row separated.
#	This allows you to add your own custom macros to the bot's keyboard as well. 
#	Add or replace default bot commands with "/%macro_name%. The macro listed in this section
#	should be defined in klipper config files, in UPPERCASE. Maximum macro name length is 54 chars.
#	This value is not validated automatically.
require_confirmation_macro: true
#	This parameter makes the bot confirm, if you want to run a macro, similar to the check which happens 
#	with the "/shutdown" command.
#	Default is true.
#	This value should be boolean.
progress_update_message: false
#	Every time status gets updated, a notification message is sent, that the progress status has been updated.
#	It gets deleted after the next status update is triggered. Setting it to false will not send notifications on progress updates.
#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.	
silent_progress: false
#	If progress_update_message is set to true, setting this to "true" sends the printer status change without an alert. 
#	You still get a "red" notification. Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. 
#	There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.
#silent_commands: false
#	Sends all other messages (for example the emergency stop confirmation) without an alert.You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.
#	Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.
silent_status: false
#	Sends the printer status change (error, idle etc.) without an alert. You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.
#	Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.
#include_macros_in_command_list: true
#	This enables in-chat autocomplete for macros. 
#	Default is true. 
#	Telegram can not handle autocompletion for commands longer than 32 symbols. Macro names which exceed this length will not get autocompleted.
#	This value should be boolean.
#hidden_macros: macro1, macro2
# 	If you have macros displayed in the auto-complete list, you may want to hide specific ones.
#	Default is not to hide any macros.
#	This value is not validated automatically.
#hidden_bot_commands: bot_restart, cancel, video
#	You may want to hide specific commands of the bot from the auto-complete list.
#	Default is not to hide any commands.
#	This value is not validated automatically.
#show_private_macros: false

#	This controls the content of the status message. You can choose to delete specific information not relevant to you.
#	Most of those parameters are self-explanatory. m117_status leaves a line to display text from the M117 gcode.

#	last_updated_time displays the time, when the status message content was last updated when using status_single_message.
